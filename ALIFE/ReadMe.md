ALIFE 2020 THEME: New Frontiers in AI: What can ALife offer AI?
The fields of AI and ALife share a common history and a common approach: true understanding of living systems can only be demonstrated by successfully re-creating them using biology and/or technology. But mind and life are two of the most mysterious systems known to us, so re-creating them is exceedingly challenging, exciting and, at times, surprising. Recently, AI has "thrown down the gauntlet" by making large strides forward in understanding some aspects of intelligence, and intelligence is one of many phenomena expressed by living systems; this suggests that more big discoveries are yet to come. So, we invite you to join us, July 2020, to continue the search for answers to life, the universe, and everything.

Developmental Embodied Agents as Meta-brain Models
Bradly Alicea, Stefan Dvoretskii, Sam Felder, Ziyi Gong, Ankit Gupta, and Jesse Parent1

Abstract
We present a framework for meta-brain models, or hybrid models that capture multiple aspects of developmental neurobiology and behavior. A developmentally-inspired embodied learning agent architecture is combined with a contextually-explicit representational layer to form a complex artificial nervous system. The architectural description is summarized in terms of morphological differentiation, context-handling, and generalized architectural features. In conclusion, we propose potential functional milestones that help further explicate the usefulness of our approach.
