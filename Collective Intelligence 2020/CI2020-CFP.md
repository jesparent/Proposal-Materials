### Collective Intelligence 2020 explores the impact of technology and big data on the ways in which people come together to communicate, combine knowledge and get work done.

## Submission details
 We accept four-page abstracts for the following kinds of submissions:
Reports of Original Research
Demonstrations of Tools/Technology/Experiments
Submissions are 3 pages of text plus 1 page for references. You are encouraged to include a graphical abstract in the submission. Note that some research or practice papers may be assigned as posters, depending on the number of submissions and room capacity of the venue. 

​Proceedings: CI’2020 does not publish archival proceedings of submissions (i.e., not published on ACM Digital Library). However, we plan to post a “book of abstracts” on the CI’20 website to make submissions available to other participants and to spur interaction.

Student Travel Grant: NSF funding is available to pay
for conference registration and travel funding for some US-based
graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty (maximum $1,200) on a
first-come first-served basis. More information can be found here.

Submission format
All submissions should be formatted as four-page extended abstracts (up to 3 pages for content and 1 page for references).

In the case of panels, the abstract should include (a) the topic to be discussed and (b) speaker biographies. Note that the panels should be exciting and promote lively discussion, and we expect the all speakers’ bios for a panel to take no more than 1 page.

All submission should use the following templates:

In order to encourage a diversity of innovative ideas from a variety of fields, submissions may refer to work that is recently published, under review elsewhere, or in preparation, and may link to up to one publicly accessible paper for the purpose of describing the work in detail. However, submissions will be evaluated solely on the submitted abstract, which must therefore comprise an entirely self-contained description of the work.

​For demos of tools/technology/experiments: Keeping with the collective intelligence conference’s emphasis on projects that address societal problems, we will also be accepting submissions of demos of innovative and interesting tools/technology or experiments. Demos could also be resubmissions from previous conferences. A demo submission should use the template above but follow the general format and general goals of a demo submission to a conference such as ACM UIST.

For Panels: abstract should include (a) the topic to be discussed and (b) speaker biographies. Note that the should be exciting and promote lively discussion and we expect the all speakers’ bios to take no more than 1 page.

After review by the Program Committee, a subset of submitted abstracts will be invited for oral presentation. They will then have the option of also presenting their submission  as a poster and/or demo. A second subset will be invited exclusively for presentation as posters and/or demos.

Authors will not receive detailed feedback from the review process, just an accept/reject decision. The main criteria will be: 1) whether the subject matter is a good fit for the Collective Intelligence conference; 2) whether there are interesting claims made with a promise to present evidence or non-obvious arguments in support of them. The review committee will not assess the validity of the evidence or arguments.

Accepted submissions will be compiled into a single report which will be made available to conference participants. We emphasize that abstracts that are distributed to conference participants are not intended to be considered archival publications or to preclude submission of the reported work to archival journals; however, we cannot guarantee that certain journals do not have policies precluding the distribution of extended abstracts. Accepted abstracts will be included as submitted (i.e., submissions should be camera-ready).

If your abstract is accepted for presentation or poster session, at least one author has to commit to attending the conference.
