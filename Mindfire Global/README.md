# Mindfire Global - Missions
2020 Update:Mindfire missions are now an essentially abandoned project. 

### Background 
Originally something I learned about from Dr Joanna Bryson at Envision 2017, a colleague of mine (Dan Elton) went to Mission 1, and became a Talent.
I applied to Mission 2, and apparently made it to the final round of applications, before the Mission or perhaps more generally, the mission component of Mindfire ceased operations.

About Mindfire
What Mindfire does :

Mindfire tackles human level artificial intelligence with the goal to advance cutting-edge research for the benefit of humankind. We believe that modern technology and latest insights in artificial intelligence and collaboration technology call for a paradigm shift of how research is conducted. By the rise of the internet and advances in latest collaboration technology, itâ€™s possible for the first time in human history to unite thousands of talents and to collaboratively solve some of the biggest challenges of our time.

 

How Mindfire works:

Mindfire unites top talents and researchers across various fields of science in the Mindfire Platform to tackle, extract and apply the principles of intelligence. Mindfire scientists build an international problem-solving network to systematically grow relevant know-how and build tangible prototypes.
