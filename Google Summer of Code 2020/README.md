### Previous Year & Motivation
In 2019, I applied to GSoC '19 via the INCF. Although I did not win the GSoC Award, I joined Orthogonal Research and Education Lab as part of its Representational Brains and Phenotypes team. I've been researching elements of modeling, emobodied cognition, and other topics as we progressed over the year and laid the groundwork for what would become the 2020 GSoC proposal, along with prior work from OLab on Contextual Geometry.
