### THE CONFERENCE

Every year since 2016, Envision has hosted an international conference to inspire students and industry leaders to pursue the prudent advancement of emerging technologies. We believe that to ensure that the future is bright, one needs to consider in depth the human implications of technological developments. Developments regarding the COVID pandemic make these efforts more important than ever. That’s why we’re planning our first-ever virtual conference for April 2021.
