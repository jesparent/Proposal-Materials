## THE 2019 CONFERENCE
     The theme of our 2019 conference is “The Future of Us.” The conference will push participants to consider how new technologies will change how we live, our social groupings, our social, political, and economic systems, our psychology, and more fundamentally, what it means to be human. This theme emanates from our deeply held belief that careful consideration of these questions is central to maximizing the benefits of innovation. 

​

### The conference will advance its theme by: 

1.  Drawing insights from wide-ranging perspectives. The conference will include speakers from several disciplines, from technological researchers, to industry leaders, to philosophers. In addition to keynote addresses, speakers will lead smaller groups of participants in interactive workshops to spur participants’ independent thinking about the implications and potential uses of new technologies. 

2. Fostering collaboration among the world’s future leaders. Participants will have the opportunity to meet driven students from around the country and abroad and form small teams to propose a product, research plan or policy that implements or improves a new technology with the mentorship of speakers.
