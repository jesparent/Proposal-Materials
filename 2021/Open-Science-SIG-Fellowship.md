# Open Science SIG Fellowship: Call for fellows
*alas, the form closed before my submission completed and/or some other error prevented me from posting fully? I figure I might as well post my submission here just in case it could still be considered*

1. Some details on your current position and background;
1. A brief statement (100 words max) on what your personal goal in open science is;
1. Links to your current and past efforts to open science (e.g. git repositories, blog posts, past events);
1. The macro-topic(s) you are most familiar with, and potential ideas for micro-topics;
1. The potential time slots that would be suitable for you during the OHBM Hackathon.

#### 1 Details
I'm currently an Assitant Science and Lab Manager at the open-science centered Orthogonal Research & Educational Lab. I'm also a contributor to the DevoWorm project within the OpenWorm Foundation. 
Within my main lab, I work to manage projects asynchornously across several timezones and project types as manager, while specifically focusing on hybrid AI and cognitive science & developmental biology inspired investigations into AI, in general. 
Beyond this, I'm involved in Science Communication projects on social media, and often engage others to join open-friendly and collaborative based projects, like Neuromatch / NM Academy, Princeton Envision, BrainHack, and other events. 
#### 2 Open Sciene Goals
My goals in open science fall into two general sentiment types, both strategic but with different emphasis: 1) bring people to the table; 2) level the playfield of the future.
The former has to do with getting people interested in investigation, pursuit of understanding, and a general sense that they can get invovled and engaged in the world through science, and both "STEM" and "STEAM" in general;
we need makers, artists, creators, and investigators of all kinds. Having a welcoming space and support in doing so is vital, and many do not have access to know how great research, science, and striving in these areas can be. 
The second 'goal' is the other side of the coin in many ways: STEM has the ability to concentrate power significantly, and by diversifying that process and opening up what we can, I believ that affords us the most choices, 'adaptability', 
as the future comes hurtling towards us. Open Science can play a key role in this, form open AI research to transparency and celebration of basic research that affords opportunities for many downstream developments.

! I forgot what they were- generally afternoons EST or Weekends are best


## Follow Up Question 
The organizers reached out to me on Twitter to ask me these questions, with my responses below. Thank you!

###
1. Are you able to attend the 2021 OHBM Hackathon from June 16 to 18?
2. Are you willing to lead small-group, hands-on training sessions during the 2021 OHBM Hackathon?
3. Within those macro-topics you're most comfortable with (version control & code testing; reproducible workflows), what are some specific subjects would you be willing to cover as a potential TA?

>  Oh sorry - 1) Yes 2) yes 3) Maybe the most so reproducible workflows and/or project management. I've recently gotten into ZenHub (a GitHub addon), but in general we use GitHub for project management extensively in our lab. I would be happy to cover project management in general, or how specific components of reproducible workflows, a documentation, automation etc all play a part in open science and effective projects.**
