### Previous Year & Motivation
In 2019, I applied to GSoC '19 via the INCF. Although I did not win the GSoC Award, I joined Orthogonal Research and Education Lab as part of its Representational Brains and Phenotypes team. I've been researching elements of modeling, emobodied cognition, and other topics as we progressed over the year and laid the groundwork for what would become the 2020 GSoC proposal, along with prior work from OREL on Contextual Geometry.

#### Submitted Proposal (Introduction)
> How did life evolve such complex behavior, and how did more advanced life forms develop their own cognitive abilities and capacities? These are broad questions in biology, computation studies, cognitive science, and philosophy. One approach involves a minimalist consideration of the nervous system and its capabilities to engage its environment or other agents within a simplified body. Building up from this functional floor offers insight of how design constraints shape behaviors as well as potential evolutionary trajectories.

> This project is a synthesis of Orthogonal Lab’s recent research foci of Contextual Geometric Structures (CGS) and developmental Braitenberg Vehicles (BV). It is about advancing the modeling of simple agents or organisms. The CGS approach affords an even more nuanced infrastructure for versatile cognitive and intelligent processing. Adding a “layer” of GCS on top of existing or novel BV set ups (or potentially using GCS as the foundation for a BV itself) is the next step in this research path. Combining these approaches offer for even more robust modeling opportunities, and potentially even more specific behavioral, social, or phenomenon to be investigated.
