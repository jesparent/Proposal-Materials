# Google Summer of Code 2019
I submitted to two projects via the INCF and Orthogonal Research & Education Laboratory. I was not accepted to receive funding and support through GSoC, however I ended up joining Orthogonal Lab originally working on the Braitenberg Vehicile and Neurobehavioral Complexity project, which lead to a longer-term collaboration with the lab.
