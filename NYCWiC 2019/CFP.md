Our Call for Participation is closed.

 

NYCWiC 2019, the 6th ACM-W New York Celebration of Women in Computing, will be held April 12-13, 2019, at the Fort William Henry Hotel and Conference Center in Lake George, NY.  The goal of NYCWiC is to encourage women to complete their studies in computing by exploring careers and meeting women leaders from business, industry, and academia.

 

We invite presentations on computing research as well as on efforts to increase diversity in computing, e.g. outreach programs or programs to engage students outside the classroom.

Computing Research

Research Talks: Fifteen minute presentations of research results; open to all.
First-timer Research Talks: Five minute presentations with room for feedback and mentoring. Open to students. Reports on preliminary results and work-in progress are welcome in this category.
Research Posters or Demos: Presentations of research, class projects and work-in-progress; open to students. Prizes will be awarded to the best student research posters in a poster competition.
Diversity Initiatives

Diversity Panel Presentations: Presentations and discussion on successful programs to diversify computing; open to all.
Diversity Posters: Presentations of efforts to diversify computing, open to all. Reports on new efforts that have not yet produced measurable results are welcome in this category.
Birds-of-a-Feather sessions 

Furthermore, we invite proposals for Birds-of-a-Feather sessions on any topic that might be of interest to the NYCWiC audience.
