# International Workshop on Embodied Intelligence
> This free event brings together a wide range of speakers to discuss the many challenges and opportunities in Embodied Intelligence research!
https://eiworkshop.org/

## EI Workshop 2021
### Programme
The workshop is structured with a morning session and afternoon session each day to accommodate different time zones. Each session includes plenary talks, panel discussions (including flash talks by leading researchers), and breakout sessions as shown in the tentative programme here. While plenary and panel speakers are invitation-only, we solicit wider contributions in breakout sessions to facilitate more focused and technical discussions. The preliminary programme can be accessed here.

### Registration
The event is completely free to attend. To register or just to stay updated, please fill in the registration form here.

### Contribute
We encourage all workshop participants to submit your views on embodied intelligence research. You are welcome to submit a title and abstract describing conceptual, theoretical, or technical contributions when you register participation here.

Once contribution is submitted, the organisers will allocate a short time slot in one of the breakout sessions. As an option, your contribution can also include an extended abstract, recorded lecture, and/or poster, which will be made available at the workshop website.

Your contribution can be edited anytime after your registration until the week before the workshop. The selected contributions will be later invited for special issue publications, book chapters, or prizes (more details later).
