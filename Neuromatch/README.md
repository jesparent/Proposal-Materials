# Neuromatch Series
Neuromatch is a suite of virtual events, two (un)conferences and one Summer School, focused on computational neuroscience during the strange, pandemic-affected year of 2020.

An unprecedented 3-week summer school, I participated in the interactive track completing the tutorials and submitting a group project.
